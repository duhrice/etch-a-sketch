# Etch-A-Sketch
This project is a simple online recreation of the Etch-A-Sketch. The goal of this project is to demonstarte skills working with the DOM. The final version of this project has two additional features added to the basse version which will be higlighted later. To use the base version, go to "commits" and use the commit labelled "44a41c8".

## How to Use
The user is intially given a 16x16 grid to draw on. The maximum grid possible is 100x100. to draw, simply hover the mouse over a box. To reset the grid, press the reset button. A prompt will be given where the user can inputted the number of boxes to appear in a line. If a number is not given, the grid will be reset to the default 16x16 grid.

## Base Version
In the base version, when a mouse hovers over a box, the box will be filled with the color black.

## Added Features
As part of the challenges specificed by The Odin Project, the following features were added:

1. Each box now use a random color instead of the color black.
2. Each time the mouse hovers over a box, the opacity of the box changes. This is best seen with small to medium-sized grids.
